# Advent of Code 2020

Hullo, I'm trying to learn a little bit of Rust via AoC20 challenges.
Ngl, probably gonna copy a little bit from better rustaceans - of course just for the sake of learning ;)


Edit: I've actually managed to finish whole Advent this year (though with a slight delay)!! YAAY!

I'm really happy with Rust - it has its pros and cons, but what I really appreciate is the borrow-checker that makes one much more mindfull of the memory management (move vs copy etc). Also even though the compilation is slow, the code runs fast and I've found myself really liking the combined styles of imperative and functional programming. I should probably try to take some time to rewrite this code (as its quite simple & short) with few things in mind (like Deref, making sure that borrowing is as intended and maybe using more Option/Result here and there).
